## Installation

Currently, our application isn't quite ready for it's beta release as it depends on a very basic `localStorage` system for saving the files.

1. To begin, to use our application you may download it from our official Github page by cloning it.

2. To initialize this project, open the root directory of the project (with package.json, etc.) and run `npm run dev` to see what our project is like.
